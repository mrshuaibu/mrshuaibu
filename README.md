### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Oluwajuwon Shuaibu
#### I am a Web Developer

Hailing from Port Harcourt, Nigeria, I developed a passion for technology at an 
early age, fueled by curiosity about how devices work and the rapid pace of 
technological advancements. Many hours were spent dismantling gadgets and 
reassembling them, which deepened my interest in both hardware and software.

My academic journey began with Computer Science at the University of Manitoba, 
where I gained foundational knowledge. However, the need for a more practical 
learning approach led me to transfer to MITT, allowing me to focus on software 
development. The ability to write code and transform ideas into functional 
solutions has been both exciting and fulfilling.

Driven by the potential of technology to address real-world challenges, I am 
committed to continuous learning and skill development. With each step, my goal 
remains to create impactful solutions that contribute meaningfully to the tech 
industry.
